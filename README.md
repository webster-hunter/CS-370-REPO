<h3>Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself? </h3>
<p>The code given was the eligible actions the agent can take, and the layout of the game environment. The code that needed to be created was the learning algorithm the pirate used in order to autonomously navigate its environment in order to solve the map and reach the treasure while avoiding obstacles. </p>

<h3>What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?</h3>
<p>Computer scientists are responsible for creating solutions to a multitude of problems that humans are generally either incapable or inefficient at. In this course, we specifically tackled the need for computer scientists to create deep learning algorithms to enhance artificial intelligence.</p>

<h3>How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?</h3>
<p>My approach to a problem as a computer scientist will be to initially analyze the existing policies that are in place, or to evaluate possible policies that I may implement. Then, I will evaluate the outcomes from said policies based on the outcomes from the system.</p>

<h3>What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization? </h3>
<p>The ethical responsibilites that I have to both the end user and the organization differ in ways that may conflict, thus it is my responsibility to find a balance that addresses each parties needs in appropriate ways. On the organizational front, I have a duty to solve a problem as accurately as possible while minimizing biases. For users, it is my job to ensure that I am not acting in ways that intrude, such as extensive data collection. These two interests are equally important; however, in the field of artificial intelligence, extensive training data is necessary to develop the most accurate product possible. Developing ways to ensure that both needs can be met in an ethical way is a core responsibility of computer scientists.<p>
